# Topic: *Behavioral Design Patterns*
## Author: *Ciobanu Andy-Constantin*
## Objectives :
__1. Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns;__

__2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about the functionalities that your system will need to provide to the user;__

__3. Implement some additional functionalities using behavioral design patterns;__

## Used Design Patterns: 
* Strategy Pattern
* Template Method Pattern

## Used Language: 
C# .NET

## Theoretical aspects : 

In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

## Conclusions
In conclusion, it can be said that *Behavioral Design Patterns* solve some important problems present in software development, namely in the architecure design process.
